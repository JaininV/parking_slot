I am trying to build a project that can provide the nearest available parking slot in parking just by scanning of QR code on the screen. Once the code scanned, it will direct the path toward to slot. It will cover Machine learning models, Artificial Intelligence concepts, the IOT field, python for the backend, and Bootstrap for design.
The sever.py file contains the each api for whole project. I uploaded the flow of my Python code on the link account https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaininvekariya_hello-there-im-jainin-vekariya-im-thrilled-activity-7121867869335810049-Tcwn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

I am using SQL workbench to store data and Postman to handle APIs of the projects and also share with this git repos here. I am still working on projects and updating them frequently. I will launch a product on 1st May with full access to users.
Thank you for reading and visiting my work. I will be grateful if you share any suggestions for me.
